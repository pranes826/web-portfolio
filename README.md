üåê Personal Portfolio (Learning HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and Grid)
This repository contains my journey of learning **web development basics**, starting from simple HTML pages to a fully styled portfolio webpage using **CSS Grid**.  

## üìÇ Project Files

- **Day 1('day1_introduction.html')**
  My first HTML page with basic structure: headings, paragraphs, image, and link.  

- **Day 2 (`day2-styling.html`)**
  Added external CSS for styling and organized content.  

- **Day 2 Flexbox (`day2-flexbox.html`)**
  Applied Flexbox layout to arrange sections neatly.
